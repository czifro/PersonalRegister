This is my first long-term project. This is to be used as a banking tool to keep track of money flow. There are some cool features like row color changer, it is set up to load the the last used file for a quicker start up. I have some more features in mind that I want to add, like using multithreading for an auto save function. And, user login so that multiple users can keep their stuff seperate. I'm in college so development on this project will be slow, but I am not going to abandon this. If you have any ideas as to how to improve this project, or are really good at multithreading, let me know.
